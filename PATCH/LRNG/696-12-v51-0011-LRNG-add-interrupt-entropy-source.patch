Subject: [PATCH v51 11/25] LRNG - add interrupt entropy source

The interrupt entropy source (ES) consumes the events triggered by the
kernel invoked with the add_interrupt_randomness. Its main goal is:

- to be extremely fast in the interrupt handler - This is guaranteed by
  only concatenating the least significant bits of a time stamp into
  CPU-local entropy pools. Thus, the operation is quasi-lockless. Also,
  the concatenation is a very trivial operation. Finally, by discarding
  the high-order bits, attacker-observable timing values are discarded.

- to use only cryptographic primitives for compression.

The IRQ entropy pool collects noise data from interrupt timing.
Any data received by the LRNG from the interrupt noise sources is
inserted into a per-CPU entropy pool using a hash operation that can
be changed during runtime. Per default, SHA-256 is used.

 (a) When an interrupt occurs, the 8 least significant bits of the
 high-resolution time stamp divided by the greatest common divisor (GCD)
 is mixed into the per-CPU entropy pool. This time stamp is credited with
 heuristically implied entropy.

 (b) HID event data like the key stroke or the mouse coordinates are
 mixed into the per-CPU entropy pool. This data is not credited with
 entropy by the LRNG.

To speed up the interrupt handling code of the LRNG, the time stamp
collected for an interrupt event is divided by the greatest common
divisor to eliminate fixed low bits and then truncated to the 8 least
significant bits. 1024 truncated time stamps are concatenated and then
jointly inserted into the per-CPU entropy pool. During boot time,
until the fully seeded stage is reached, each time stamp with its
32 least significant bits is are concatenated. When 1024/32 = 32 such
events are received, they are injected into the per-CPU entropy pool.

The IRQ ES is only enabled if the existing random number generator
(random.c) is not compiled.
