- * find_energy_efficient_cpu(): Find most energy-efficient target CPU for the
- * waking task. find_energy_efficient_cpu() looks for the CPU with maximum
- * spare capacity in each performance domain and uses it as a potential
- * candidate to execute the task. Then, it uses the Energy Model to figure
- * out which of the CPU candidates is the most energy-efficient.
- *
- * The rationale for this heuristic is as follows. In a performance domain,
- * all the most energy efficient CPU candidates (according to the Energy
- * Model) are those for which we'll request a low frequency. When there are
- * several CPUs for which the frequency request will be the same, we don't
- * have enough data to break the tie between them, because the Energy Model
- * only includes active power costs. With this model, if we assume that
- * frequency requests follow utilization (e.g. using schedutil), the CPU with
- * the maximum spare capacity in a performance domain is guaranteed to be among
- * the best candidates of the performance domain.
- *
- * In practice, it could be preferable from an energy standpoint to pack
- * small tasks on a CPU in order to let other CPUs go in deeper idle states,
- * but that could also hurt our chances to go cluster idle, and we have no
- * ways to tell with the current Energy Model if this is actually a good
- * idea or not. So, find_energy_efficient_cpu() basically favors
- * cluster-packing, and spreading inside a cluster. That should at least be
- * a good thing for latency, and this is consistent with the idea that most
- * of the energy savings of EAS come from the asymmetry of the system, and
- * not so much from breaking the tie between identical CPUs. That's also the
- * reason why EAS is enabled in the topology code only for systems where
- * SD_ASYM_CPUCAPACITY is set.
- *
- * NOTE: Forkees are not accepted in the energy-aware wake-up path because
- * they don't have any useful utilization data yet and it's not possible to
- * forecast their impact on energy consumption. Consequently, they will be
- * placed by find_idlest_cpu() on the least loaded CPU, which might turn out
- * to be energy-inefficient in some use-cases. The alternative would be to
- * bias new tasks towards specific types of CPUs first, or to try to infer
- * their util_avg from the parent task, but those heuristics could hurt
- * other use-cases too. So, until someone finds a better way to solve this,
- * let's keep things simple by re-using the existing slow path.
