Subject: [PATCH] muqss: Revert invocation of "finish_cpu" when offlining core

Backporting the equivalent change in sched/core.c to sched/MuQSS.c in
function, idle_task_exit, causes an oops at boot with MuQSS.

Instead, make an exception for MuQSS so "finish_cpu" is not executed
while running MuQSS and retain the original "idle_task_exit"
implementation.
