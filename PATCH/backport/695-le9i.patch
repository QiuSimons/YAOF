le9i.patch
revision 4 from le9h.patch: removed CONFIG_IKCONFIG_PROC because I remembered that IKCONFIG_PROC was initially used by le9e.patch as a personal preference(so I'd know whether CONFIG_LE9D_PATCH was part of the kernel ie. was patch applied to the running kernel?), but for everyone else it's not needed because the presence of the sysctl values gives away that the patch was applied or not!

le9i.patch
trying to keep inactive ones above threshold too, to see if no freezes with memtest3
these freezes seem to be caused by writing dmesg/journald, but in fact are possibly caused by both!
a better patch would be keeping executable data unevictable - so todo: see memlockd

Interesting, a phoronix user here https://www.phoronix.com/forums/forum/phoronix/general-discussion/1118164-yes-linux-does-bad-in-low-ram-memory-pressure-situations-on-the-desktop/page17#post1120291 linked to two older patches(that I was completely unaware of) which are supposedly doing this same thing (9yrs ago for the first, Oct 23, 2018 or earlier for the second):
https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/222042/
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/seanpaul/dpu-staging/commit/0b992f2dbb044896c3584e10bd5b97cf41e2ec6d

they seem way more complicated though, at first glance.
but hey, they were at least aware of the issue and how to fix it!

+unevictable_activefile_kbytes
+=============================
+
+How many kilobytes of `Active(file)` to never evict during high-pressure
+low-memory situations. ie. never evict active file pages if under this value.
+This will help prevent disk thrashing caused by Active(file) being close to zero
+in such situations, especially when no swap is used.
+
+As 'nivedita' (phoronix user) put it:
+"Executables and shared libraries are paged into memory, and can be paged out
+even with no swap. [...] The kernel is dumping those pages and [...] immediately
+reading them back in when execution continues."
+^ and that's what's causing the disk thrashing during memory pressure.
+
+unevictable_activefile_kbytes=X will prevent X kbytes of those most used pages
+from being evicted.
+
+The default value is 65536. That's 64 MiB.
+
+Set it to 0 to keep the default behaviour, as if this option was never
+implemented, so you can see the disk thrashing as usual.
+
+To get an idea what value to use here for your workload(eg. xfce4 with idle
+terminals) to not disk thrash at all, run this::
+
+	$ echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches; grep -F 'Active(file)' /proc/meminfo
+	1
+	Active(file):     203444 kB
+
+so, using vm.unevictable_activefile_kbytes=203444 would be a good idea here.
+(you can even add a `sleep` before the grep to get a slightly increased value,
+which might be useful if something is compiling in the background and you want
+to account for that too)
+
+But you can probably go with the default value of just 65536 (aka 64 MiB)
+as this will eliminate most disk thrashing anyway, unless you're not using
+an SSD, in which case it might still be noticeable (I'm guessing?).
+
+Note that `echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches` can still cause
+Active(file) to go a under the vm.unevictable_activefile_kbytes value.
+It's not an issue and this is how you know how much the value for
+vm.unevictable_activefile_kbytes should be, at the time/workload when you ran it.
+
+The value of `Active(file)` can be gotten in two ways::
+
+	$ grep -F 'Active(file)' /proc/meminfo
+	Active(file):    2712004 kB
+
+and::
+
+	$ grep nr_active_file /proc/vmstat
+	nr_active_file 678001
+
+and multiply that with MAX_NR_ZONES (which is 4), ie. `nr_active_file * MAX_NR_ZONES`
+so 678001*4=2712004  kB
+
+MAX_NR_ZONES is 4 as per:
+`include/generated/bounds.h:10:#define MAX_NR_ZONES 4 /* __MAX_NR_ZONES */`
+and is unlikely the change in the future.
